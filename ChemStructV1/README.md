# ChemStruct üß™üî¨  

**ChemStruct** is an AI-powered system that enhances molecular visualization by converting **chemical names, photographed structures, and video footage of reactions** into **detailed 2D and 3D molecular models**. By integrating **DeepChem, RDKit, OpenBabel, and computer vision**, the system aims to bridge the gap between theoretical chemistry concepts and real-world molecular interactions, making learning more interactive and insightful.  

## üõë Problem Statement  
Understanding and visualizing molecular structures can be challenging, especially in **experiments like acid-base titrations**. Traditional learning methods rely on **theoretical explanations and static diagrams**, making it difficult to grasp how molecules interact and change during chemical reactions. This lack of visualization creates a gap in understanding, especially in **complex chemistry concepts**.  

This project aims to **bridge this gap** by developing a system that **detects color transitions**, dynamically **generates molecular structures**, and converts **IUPAC names, common names, and photographed images of chemical structures** into accurate **2D and 3D molecular representations**.  

## üéØ Objectives  
- **Chemical Name to Structure Conversion**: Develop a system that converts **IUPAC and common chemical names** into **2D and 3D molecular models** for enhanced structure visualization.  
- **Image-Based Molecular Structure Recognition**: Develop a method for processing **photographed chemical structures** to generate **precise 3D molecular models** with **detailed descriptions**, improving molecular interpretation.  
- **Video-Based Acid-Base Titration Analysis**: Develop a **video-based acid-base titration analysis system** that detects **color transitions** (e.g., pink to colorless) and dynamically generates **molecular structures** to track reaction progress in real time.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack  
- **DeepChem** | **RDKit** | **OpenBabel** | **Computer Vision**  
- **PubChem API** for chemical data retrieval  
- **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** for extracting chemical information from images  
- **Machine Learning (CNN, Regression Models)** for chemical structure recognition and reaction tracking  
- **Flutter** for app development (Android & iOS)
